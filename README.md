# Typographic Keyboard
The default keyboard layout on Windows has always annoyed me. It&#8217;s hard to use proper punctuation. Although applications like Word automatically turn your straight quotes into smart quotes, your hyphens into en- or em-dashes, other applications &#8211; notably the browsers &#8211; don&#8217;t.

Luckily the men and women from Redmond have made [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator][1] available to the public. This allowed me to properly configure my keyboard. If you like it better too, feel free to use or modify it.

Now you can tweet like a gentleman and use those fancy curly quotes with ease.

## Features
* The United States (international) keyboard is left unchanged as much as possible.
* The Alt-Gr modifier key is utilized to access the more advanced typographic option.
* For your convenience all advanced typographic options are located at the left side of the keyboard, because the Alt-Gr key is usually located on the right.
* Use Alt-Gr key combinations to put accents on characters such as *&egrave;*.
* It is no longer neccessairy to type a space after straight quote keys to get an actual straight quote (great for programming).
* Curly quotes and other advanced puntuation marks are easily accessable.

## Installation
* Open *setup.exe* &#8211; located in the *Build* folder &#8211; to quickly and easily install the keyboard layout.
* In case you don&#8217;t trust an executable from some random guy at GitHub (you shouldn&#8217;t), you can build your own layout from the *.klc* file. You should download the [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator][1] for this.
